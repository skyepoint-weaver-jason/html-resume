        <ul>
            <li><b>Yoga</b> - my partner and I own a Hatha Yoga Studio called <a href="https://comfortablesteadyyoga.com">Comfortable Steady Yoga - Ashburn</a> in Ashburn Virginia USA
            <br>
            <P>
                I started yoga after years of studying martial arts and QiGong.  I reached a point where the Martial Arts, even Tai Chi, felt to violent for me. 
                I wanted to retain the physical aspects but even more importantly were the mental, emotional and energetic aspects of the practice. I tried Bikram Yoga 
                and Really liked that, but the warm-up, practice in 103 degree studio and cooldown required to much time for my schedule.  I sought out other Yoga and Meditation
                Studios and eventually discovered Traditional Hatha Yoga as the best practice for me.
